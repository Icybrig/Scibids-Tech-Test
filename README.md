# Scibids-Tech-Test

Exercise:
Scibids ran an A/B test for one of our clients.
The test ran from July 1st - July 31st.
The KPIs were landing page pixel loads (CPA based on DCM stats) and CTR.
The client felt that due to the CTR performance of their IO they outperformed Scibids IO.
The exercise is all based on the same data included in: AB_Test.xlsx
Our target is to present to our client the AB test to prove our value. For this our strategy
would be :
1) Defend AB test results and try to convince that Scibids did good and why
2) Find a way to estimate Scibids financial impact on this campaign
A valuable output is a “simple to understand” output with some clear key take-aways.
There is no “right” way to do this, we just want to see your thought process. Please include
all workings / explanations of methodology.
Data manipulations must be done in python and handed out (within a script or Jupyter
Notebook). Data visualization can be achieved in other ways than python but source data for
the viz should be available somewhere within the code.
